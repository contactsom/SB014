I have doubt other than teaching. As I'm not getting the recording of sessions where can I find?

If your class is declared as public , which means you can access from anywhere .

What is the Meaning of "access from anywhere" ?

access from anywhere depends up on "Package Level"

What is the Meaning of "Package Level" ?
	1. Within the Package
	2. Out Side the Package


How to Create the Object of Class ?
1. Using "new" key word

Example :
	Class Employee {}
	
Syntex :
	ClassName objectName = new classConstructor();
Ex :
	Employee  employee  = new Employee();
	
	
	Class Student {}
	
Create the Object of Student Class :
	Student student = new Student();
	Student rajpal = new Student();
	Student amisha = new Student();
	Student mahesh = new Student();
