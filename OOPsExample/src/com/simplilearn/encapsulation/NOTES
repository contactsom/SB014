Encapsulation Rule :
1. A Class is said to be highly encapsulated iff every data member declared in the class is "private".
2. setter and getter method should not be there other than "private".


setterMethod()- Which will help you to set the data 
getterMethod()- Which will help you to get the data


Class A {

	private int a = 0;
	

}

Class B extends A {

	int c = 90;

}

Class C extends A{

	private int d = 20;

}
